# Coding Exercise: 2-Object Orientation/4-static


## Coding: Java-static

Create a new project in IntelliJ and write a Java class with static and instance variables and methods.

* Step 1: Create a class with a static variable 'totalCount' and an instance variable 'instanceCount'. Initialize both variables with the value 0.
* Step 2: Write a static method 'incrementTotalCount' that increments the 'totalCount' by 1.
* Step 3: Write an instance method 'incrementInstanceCount' that increments the 'instanceCount' for the object by 1.
* Step 4: In the main method, create multiple objects of the class and call both the static and instance methods.
* Step 5: Override the ToString method to output the current values of 'totalCount' and 'instanceCount'.

## Bonus

Wow, you guys are fast! If you like, also work on this optional bonus task.

* Create a new class 'Calculator' with a static method 'add' that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.
* Write code in the main method to call the 'add' method and print the result.
* Optional: Implement additional static methods in the 'Calculator' class (subtraction, multiplication, division) and call them in the main method.
